# Superconducting diode effects
**<time data-format="MMMM D YYYY H:mm" datetime="2022-05-17T12:00:00+00:00">May 17 2022 14:00</time>â€“<time data-format="H:mm" datetime="2022-03-31T17:00:00+00:00">17:00</time>** (all times are in <span id="timezone">CET</span> timezone)

In the last few years, experimental breakthroughs in the field of non-reciprocal superconductivity have led to the realization of the superconducting diode effect in both bulk and junction based systems (Josephson diode), both with and without an applied magnetic field. These results raise fundamental questions as to the origins and mechanisms of the different superconducting diode effects as well as open the door to game-changing advancements in superconducting electronics for technological applications. In this workshop, we bring together experimentalists creating and exploring novel superconducting diodes as well as theorists explaining and predicting these effects.
